### Education
Physics, B.S. University of Kansas (University & Departmental Honors)



### Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Spring Venture Group (_2017 - 2023_)**

- Serve as a primary resource for standing up new data science efforts. Defining
requirements, auditing data hygiene, POC modeling, establishing documentation standards, and providing reporting/visibility. Guiding C-suite executives for intraday operational adjustments & budgeting. 

- Train, Deploy, & Monitored Prediction Models for:
  - (ML) Prospective revenue for leads to be purchased from auction space (~$100k/day budget).
  - (non-ML) Auction win likelihood modeling.
  - (ML) Auction frequency for budgeting & configuring bidding model.
  - (ML) Batch predictions of revenue for prospective lead-to-customer matches for outbound marketing.
  - (ML) Daily business revenue expectations for given operational inputs to inform monthly and annual budgeting (~$4,000,000/month).
  - (ML) Likelihood of inbound calls being answered by available agents.

- Co-Design, Monitor, & Maintain Production Services:
  (Python Fast API hosted on AWS EC2, all services configurable)
  (All designed with A/B experimentation capabilities)
  - Bidding model for purchasing leads (spends on orders of $10^7 annually).
  - Lead-to-customer matcher for dialer system.
  - Inbound call accept/reject decider service.
  - Underwriting U.I. for insurance sales agents to suggest the best carrier for customers.

- Design & Execute Experimentation for Business Operations:
  - All above-described "Production Services"
  - Customer retention calls to decrease churn rate & improve LTV.
  - Allocating annual marketing budgets on the order of 10^7 to monthly, daily, hourly, and intra-hourly budgets for optimally acquiring sales leads.

**Particle Physics Detector Researcher @ University of Kansas (_2011-2017_)**
(in collaboration with CERN's CMS experiment)
- Designed & conducted X-ray fluorescence testing procedures as a low-cost alternative to particle detector for CMS's Phase 1 Pixel Upgrade.
  - assisted other universities with setting up the same.
  - (_2013_) On-site: set up & conducted the same experiment at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland, part of NSF 'Pixel PIRE' program.
- Simulated hypothetical detector configurations for CMS's Phase 2 Pixel Upgrade proposal.
- Presented findings at CERN, PSI, an APS meeting, and ~100 international teleconferences.
